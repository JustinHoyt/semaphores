        until the front car finishes crossing). This is called head-of-line blocking. Otherwise, it can either
        drive through, or turn left, or turn right (U-turn is not allowed). But it should first check the traffic
        light in front.
        • Green Light: If it attempts to drive through, make sure that no car from the opposite direction
        is turing left, or any car is turning right to the same lane; if it attempts to turn left, make sure
        that no car is driving through the intersection in the opposite direction, or any car is turning right
        to the same lane; if it attempts to turn right, make sure that no car is driving to the same lane.
        • Yellow Light: If it attempts to turn right, make sure that no car is driving to the same lane,
        otherwise it should stop in front of the intersection.
        • Red Light: If it attempts to drive through or turn left, it should wait for the Green light and then
        follows the rule for Green Light; if it attempts to turn right, make sure that no car is driving to
        the same lane.
